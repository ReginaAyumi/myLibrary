                                <p>
                                    No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. <br><br>

                                    Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star scomedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</span>

                                <h3>Rich Dad Poor Dad</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, had two main influential fathers in his life. 

                                    Poor Dad was Kiyosaki's biological father, a man who was highly intelligent and very well educated. Poor Dad believed in studying hard and getting good grades, then finding a well-paying job. Yet, despite these seemingly positive attributes, Poor Dad didn't do well financially.<br><br>

                                    Rich Dad was the father of Kiyosaki's best friend. He had a similar work ethic to Kiyosaki's real dad, but <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> with a twist. Rich Dad believed in financial education, learning how money works, and understanding how to make money work for you. Although he was an eighth-grade dropout, Rich Dad eventually became a millionaire by putting the power of money to work for him. <br><br>

                                    The book is written from Kiyosaki's perspective of how Rich Dad went about making money and the mistakes that Poor Dad made. The first six chapters of Rich Dad Poor Dad make up about two-thirds of the book and discuss the six lessons that Kiyosaki learned from his Rich Dad. <br><br>

                                    Robert T. Kiyosaki learned early on that the real reason the rich get richer and the poor get poorer fix the financial savvy passed down from one generation to the next, rather than the money itself. RICH DAD, POOR DAD uses the author's two "fathers" -- one, an entrepreneur who mentored Kiyosaki, and his real father, an academic -- as models of two starkly different approaches to finance.Kiyosaki's many insights for individual investors include: <br>
                                    - How to raise capital for investments without going to the bank <br>
                                    - Why a high salary alone can't create real wealth<br>
                                    - Why "study hard, get good grades, find a secure job" is the most dangerous advice a parent can give</span>
